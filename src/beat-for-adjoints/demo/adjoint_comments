* Scope of dolfin_adjoint objects?

* Replay before Taylor remainder in tutorial?

* Missing doc-string for dolfin_replay

* Why don't dolfin_adjoint annotate anything (in the case with dt =
  0.2, so just an project + assign) (Nothing shows up in the
  forward.html)

* Comment replay can report discrepancies due to tolerance in
  solvers!! (Why?)

* Should add comment on what type of objects dJdic etc are in the
  tutorial
